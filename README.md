## Experimental rewrite

The idea is experiment with going full-on with shipping es modules with the lessons learned, and see how small, how fast, and how modular we can go.

Currently the rewrite sits comfortably just under 2kb, with a theoratical performance improvement(haven't test anything yet). This estimate includes the prefixer so excluded this would sit within the low-range ballpark of around ~1kb.

In comparision the current version sits around ~4kb.

## AST(maybe)

```js
const root = {
	value: "",
	type: "root",
	props: [],
	children: [...],
	line: 1,
	column: 1,
	caret: 0
}
const comment = {
	value: "/*! Lorem ipsum dolor sit. */",
	type: "comment",
	props: '!',
	children: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit.",
	line: 1,
